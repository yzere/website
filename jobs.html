            <h2>Support specialist</h2>
            <p> <strong> Primary duties:</strong> A computer programmer is someone who writes new computer software using coding languages like HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Video game software can be updated to improve online gameplay, which is an opportunity for programmers to troubleshoot problems experienced by gamers after the game is released to the general public.
            </p>
            <p> <strong> Requirements:</strong> A programmer typically completes a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and an internship to build their skills. Certifications are also strongly encouraged, and there are many coding academies to choose from.

            <h2>Help desk analyst</h2>
            <p> <strong> Primary duties:</strong> Many tech workers have debuted on the help desk. Typically, you’ll start off at Tier 1, which is triage work where calls regarding complex issues are processed to Tier 2 for more in-depth support. At Tier 1, you’ll be logging incoming calls and offering help for relatively straightforward matters. </strong></p>
            <p> <strong> Requirements:</strong>  Soft skills are a must when working the help desk, especially communication and problem solving. Previous customer service experience is a plus. While you may not need technical knowledge at this entry stage, understanding the topics you’ll handle can be a big help. For example, if the help desk fields networking queries, a bit of networking savvy will be beneficial. Even if you don’t come with existing knowledge, what you learn at Tier 1 will help you build a foundation as you move forward in your career. Many companies will provide on-the-job training to help you grow your skills. </strong></p>

            <p> <strong>Primary duties: </strong>In this job, you’ll build applications, usually using compiled languages like Java and C++, fix bugs identified by quality assurance and be responsible for deployment. A software developer generally works with a larger team, guiding each project through a development cycle, so understanding Agile can score you major points with hiring managers. </p>
            <p> <strong>Requirements: </strong>An IT-related degree is a must when applying for junior developer positions. However, those without degrees might be able to catch employers’ eyes by engaging with the development community through hackathons, open source projects and making their code available on GitHub.</p>

Front-end web developers combine an understanding of design and usability with practical development skills in web-related languages to create functional and attractive environments for users.</p>
            <p> <strong>Requirements: </strong>A phenomenal website and portfolio are essential to show employers you can deliver on responsiveness and convenience. You should be knowledgeable in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and you may need experience with testing procedures. Certification for web development could bolster your skills, but do your homework before investing in certifications as there are currently no industry standards.  </p>

QA analysts are responsible for this, using a test plan and tools to identify any bugs or inconsistencies that need to be logged and fixed before products are released.</p>
            <p> <strong>Requirements: </strong> An IT-related degree is generally preferred, as well as a working knowledge of software development methodologies like Agile. More importantly, you’ll need to be an analytical problem-solver with exceptional attention to detail.</p>
